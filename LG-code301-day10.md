# LG Code 301 - Day 10  

### Guess who back, back again  

Brian's back tell a friend. I found it best to not worry about my backlog of work and to be focused on the present. This ended up being helpful since we build each day on previous lessons. There is a lot of terminology I don't understand right now but I'm grasping at the core concepts. This should make make up work go easier.  

It's great feeling more like myself again. I have my energy back up. Stay positive and see what I can get done this weekend. Even if I don't make it I can at least tel myself I did my best. Though, I have a feeling with the help of all my friends I won't fail. They won't let me.
