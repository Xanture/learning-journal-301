# LG Code 301 - Day 1  

### Is this the real life?

Friday might have now been the hardest day at Code Fellows. I think my friends are feeling the same. Even after finally getting a full nights sleep I'm exhausted.  

So what did I learn the last 2 days? Something about handlebars. Something about forms. I'll need to watch the lecture videos again.  

I have a lot of work to do this weekend. I'm pretty sure I'm starting to get sick but I need to drive on. Hopefully next week I'm more present to learn.
