# LG Code 301 - Day 1"  

### The Learning Journal of Mark up  

It feels really great being back at Code Fellows. I was thinking that Duncan would be a hard act to follow, but Sam is outstanding. I couldn't be more satisfied with my 301 class. So it seems that I'll be taking the opportunity to practice some markdown here. Let's first make a list of things I learned.  

- About Mobile first design  
- Media Query  
- Model View Controller (MVC)

I'm looking forward to all the challenges I will face during these next 4 weeks. My goals are to be engaged each day, stay positive, and uplift my classmates when they are down. Also super stoked Liz is our Lead TA. We even get Ben back for a week! This couldn't get any better!

# LG Code 301 - Day 3  

### Rough days, but sunshine ahead

Actually it's going to rain the next few days but this is how I manage my stress. Yesterday I had some setback because it took me a long time to find the lecture notes after the portion of the Youtube lecture was bugged out. I couldn't figure out what to search for in the book for the string I needed. A little bummbed but it's okay. I'll finish my project this weekend. Didn't get to work on my portfolio.
